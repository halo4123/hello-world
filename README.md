# hello-world
This is the repository of my ideas :)
There are things in life just inspire myself to create some tools. Those tool could have been existing at somewhere else in the world but it still feel exciting to come up with ideas by my own :)

I came back to github thankfully, because I rememebered the feeling when I wrote down the words above. This is also inspiring, maybe I should comeback and write more in the leater days just to mark my feelings.
